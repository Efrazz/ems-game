- Add static platform
- Add platforms dynamically
- Add platforms to group
- Make background move (if endless runner is what we want to do)
- Give it temporary name


Pull/Push routine
- Pull to make sure you have latest version of the project, either from main or personal branch

Things to go through
- Image import, Sania's solution
- .gitignore file and function
- Setting up Prettier and ESLint for consistent code (argument: it causes issues when using github if you write code in different ways. It's also going to be important in a working environment, this is a golden opportunity to learn more about it)
